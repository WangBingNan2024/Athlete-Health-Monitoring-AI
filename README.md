# Athlete Health Monitoring AI

This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor athlete health using multi-modal data, including EEG (Electroencephalography), heart rate (HR), and movement data. The goal is to enhance the well-being of athletes by monitoring mental fatigue, stress, and physiological conditions, while preventing injuries and optimizing performance.

## Project Overview

The project uses a **Multi-Modal Transformer model** that integrates EEG, heart rate, and movement data to assess mental and physical health. Additionally, a **Temporal Attention mechanism** is implemented to focus on relevant physiological data over time, providing more accurate predictions.

This model is evaluated on datasets containing EEG signals, heart rate, and movement data collected from athletes across different sports contexts. The system can send alerts for health risks based on real-time monitoring.

## Dataset

The following datasets are used for training and testing the model:
1. **SST-2 Dataset**: A sentiment analysis dataset from movie reviews.
2. **TweetEval Dataset**: A dataset for sentiment analysis on social media content.
3. **SentiMix Dataset**: A multilingual dataset for sentiment analysis in mixed languages.
4. **SEED Dataset**: EEG signals from participants exposed to affective stimuli, capturing real-time emotional responses.

## Future Work

While this project provides a strong foundation for athlete health monitoring, there are many avenues for further development:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implementing real-time data streaming and processing for live athlete monitoring during sports events.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Integrating more diverse datasets from different sports and environments to improve model generalization.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extending the model to handle multi-lingual data for broader applicability in international settings.
- **Improved Model Architecture**: Experimenting with other deep learning architectures, such as Transformer variants and attention mechanisms, to further enhance model accuracy and responsiveness.
